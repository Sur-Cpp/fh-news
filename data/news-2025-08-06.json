    "p1": "On August 6, 2025, the Factions Hub Council (after absolutely zero bribes) officially announced Sur's candidacy for FH President. Supporters of Sur have never been more happier.'",
    "p2": "The campaign launch took place in the newly proposed SCP 682 Containement Chamber, which, for the record, will not be used for creating a 10 stories high statue of Mitch. The Containement Chamber will now include democratic things like zero dictator towers. And before you ask - no, it will not be a dictatorship.",
    "p3": "Construction is expected to start soon, pending zero coup attempts. And to be clear: Sur is not becoming a dictator. Did we mention that? No dictatorship. Like, at all. He's nice. Really nice. Loves democracy. Huge fan. Not a dictator. Totally normal. Super chill. Did we mention - **not** a dictatorship?"
